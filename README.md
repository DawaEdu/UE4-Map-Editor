How to get started
-------------------

The current __Map Editor__ is based on Unreal Engine version _4.7.0 Preview 4 Build_. You can always get this version (or higher) of the engine using the [Unreal Engine Launcher](https://www.unrealengine.com/dashboard), or you can grab the [full engine source](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/releases/tag/4.4.0-preview) from GitHub and compile it yourself.

**Without Git Client:**

- Download the project by clicking the **Download Source** button on this page.
- Unzip the files to a folder on your computer.  
- Load up [Unreal Editor](https://www.unrealengine.com/dashboard)
- On the Project Browser screen, click **Browse** and navigate to the folder where unzipped the files.
- Choose the **Map_Editor.uproject** file.

_NOTE: It's better to use a Git Client to fork this project so you can submit your contributions back to your fork._

**With Git Client:**

- You'll want to create your own Map Editor **fork** by clicking the __Fork button__ in the top right of this page.
- Next, [install a Git client](http://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) on your computer.
- Use the GitHub program to **Sync** the project's files to a folder on your machine.
- You can now open up **Map_Editor.uproject** in the editor!
- Using the GitHub program, you can easily **submit contributions** back up to your **fork**.

You can contribute changes using [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).
